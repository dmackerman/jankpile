# Jankpile

Jankpile is a web app to help Magic: the Gathering players construct Brawl and Historic Brawl decks.  Players can search for commanders by color, select a commander, then add spells and lands to their deck.  Jankpile includes search features to help players find spells that go well with their commander, and also summarizes decks to help players know the right combination of lands to add.
